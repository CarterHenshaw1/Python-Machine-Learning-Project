# Python-Machine-Learning-Project
As a final project for my machine learning course, I was tasked with importing a dataset that contained fictional data from a music streaming service. The goal of the project was to run many different machine learning models on the data, determine which was most accurate, save the best model as a pkl file, then apply the best model to a smaller dataset with new but similar data and predict which users of the streaming service were likely to convert from free to paid users. I then exported the predictions to an Excel file so it could be easily digestible.

The machine learning models I used were decision tree, random forest, KNN, SGD, and SVM.

The best model for this type of data ended up being the SVM model, which I then applied to the smaller set of data.
